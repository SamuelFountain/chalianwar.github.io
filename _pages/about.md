I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Minnesota. My
research interests lie at the intersection of distributed systems and machine
learning. The overarching goal of my research is to enable efficient and flexible systems
for the growing data demands of modern applications, like distributed machine
learning, running on existing as well as emerging computing platforms. My
ongoing work focuses on (1) Distributed Machine/Federated Learning systems, (2)
Serverless and microservice-based systems, and (3) Efficient storage for Docker
containers.

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from
Virginia Tech (VT). Before joining UMN, I worked at IBM Research as a Research Staff Member (2018 to 2022).
In my earlier years (2009 to 2013), I worked as a tools
developer on various open source projects (GNU GDB, Embedded Linux, and
BusyBox) at Mentor Graphics.

I have received Best Paper Awards from ACM AISec 2019 on my work on privacy-preserving
Federated Learning, from DGS EGOV 2020 on e-government implementations
and applications, and from IEEE Cloud 2022 again on privacy-preserving Federated Learning.
At IBM, I have been recognized as a 2019 Outstanding
Research Accomplishment winner for "Advancing Adversarial Robustness in AI
Models". In 2020, I received two Research Accomplishment awards for my research
on i) Enterprise-Strength Federated Learning for Hybrid Cloud and Edge, and ii)
Container Storage. In 2021, I received Outstanding Technical Achievement Award on my contributions to the
"Enterprise-Strength Federated Learning for Hybrid Cloud and Edge". I am also a
co-inventor of 10+ U.S. patents.
